Meeting Transcript: Project Alpha Deadline Sync
Duration: 4 minutes
Attendees: Alex (PM), Jamie (Design), Taylor (Dev), Morgan (QA)

Alex (PM):
"Thanks for joining, everyone. Let’s keep this quick—we’re here to confirm the status of Project Alpha’s MVP before the Friday deadline. Jamie, how’s the design handoff?"

Jamie (Design):
"All screens are finalized and uploaded to Figma. I’ve tagged Taylor in the specs—just waiting on the animation assets, which I’ll send by EOD today."

Taylor (Dev):
"Got it. I’ve integrated 80% of the UI. The API delays might push backend work to Thursday, but we’ll still hit the deadline if QA can start testing Wednesday afternoon."

Morgan (QA):
"That’s tight, but doable. Taylor, can you flag high-risk areas for me to prioritize? Also, Alex—are we still aiming for a Friday 3 PM deploy?"

Alex (PM):
"Yes, no changes there. Morgan, I’ll send you the test cases by tomorrow. Jamie, thanks for the quick turnaround. Taylor, keep us posted on the API. Any blockers?"

Taylor (Dev):
"None yet. I’ll Slack updates by EOD."

Alex (PM):
"Perfect. Let’s reconvene Thursday if anything changes. Meeting adjourned!"
